<h2 id="major-components"><a class="header" href="#major-components">Major components</a></h2>
<p>yk is a meta-tracing system that turns existing C interpreters into
JIT-compiling VMs. It is comprised of two major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>ykllvm</code> is a fork of <a href="https://llvm.org/%5D">LLVM</a> that must be used to:
compile C interpreters with the necessary extra information for yk; link
in the <code>yk</code> Rust library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>yk</code> Rust library is the core of the run-time JIT system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>yk utilises two different <em>Intermediate Representations</em> (IRs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>AOT IR</em> is the Ahead-Of-Time IR generated by ykllvm and embedded in the
binary of a C interpreter. AOT IR is similar to LLVM IR, though customised
and simplified for yk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>JIT IR</em> is the IR generated (from AOT IR) at run-time by yk and which is
dynamically converted into machine code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three styles of "trace" in yk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a hot loop in a program is detected, the actions of the interpreter
are recorded to make an <em>AOT IR trace</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AOT IR trace is combined with AOT IR and then compiled into JIT IR to
make a <em>JIT IR trace</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JIT IR trace is compiled into machine code to make an <em>executable trace</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This section details how to get yk up and running.</p>
<h2 id="system-requirements"><a class="header" href="#system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, yk requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Linux system with a CPU that supports Intel Processor Trace.
(<code>grep intel_pt /proc/cpuinfo</code> to check)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux perf (for collecting PT traces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="user/interps.html">Yk-enabled programming language interpreter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent nightly install of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that at present, non-root users can only use Yk if
<code>/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</code> is set to <code>-1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="building"><a class="header" href="#building">Building</a></h2>
<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/ykjit/yk">main yk repository</a> and build
it with <code>cargo</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 \
  https://github.com/ykjit/yk/
$ cd yk
$ cargo build --release
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will also clone <a href="https://github.com/ykjit/ykllvm">ykllvm</a> as a
submodule of yk. If you later want access to the full git history, either
remove <code>--depth 1</code> or run <code>git fetch --unshallow</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="available-interpreters"><a class="header" href="#available-interpreters">Available Interpreters</a></h1>

</div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="development"><a class="header" href="#development">Development</a></h1>
<p>This section explains how to setup and use yk.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="configuring-the-build"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-build">Configuring the build</a></h1>
<p>Start by following the <a href="dev/../user/install.html#building">general installation
instructions</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>yk</code> repo is a Rust workspace (i.e. a collection of crates). You can build
and test in the usual ways using <code>cargo</code>. For example, to build and test the
system, run:</p>
<pre><code>cargo test
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ykb_ykllvm_bin_dir"><a class="header" href="#ykb_ykllvm_bin_dir"><code>YKB_YKLLVM_BIN_DIR</code></a></h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, yk builds a copy of its LLVM fork "ykllvm", which
it also uses it to build interpreters (via the compiler's use of <code>yk-config</code>).
You can use your own ykllvm build by specifying the directory where the
executables (e.g. <code>clang</code>, <code>llvm-config</code>, and so on) are stored with
<code>YKB_YKLLVM_BIN_DIR</code>.</p>
<p>yk does not check your installation for compatibility: it is your
responsibility to ensure that your ykllvm build matches that expected by yk.</p>
<p>It is also undefined behaviour to move between defining this variable and not
within a repository using <code>yk</code> (including the <code>yk</code> repository itself). If you
want to set/unset <code>YKB_YKLLVM_BIN_DIR</code> then <code>cargo clean</code> any repositories
using <code>yk</code> before rebuilding them.</p>
<h2 id="ykb_tracer"><a class="header" href="#ykb_tracer"><code>YKB_TRACER</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>YKB_TRACER</code> environment variable allows building yk with either <code>hwt</code>
(Hardware Tracer) or <code>swt</code> (Software Software Tracer).</p>
<p><code>swt</code> - CPU architecture-independent. The default.</p>
<p><code>hwt</code> - Relies on Intel PT. Suitable only for x86 CPUs supporting it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="run-time-configuration"><a class="header" href="#run-time-configuration">Run-time configuration</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of environment variables which control the run_time
behaviour of the yk system.</p>
<h2 id="general-configuration"><a class="header" href="#general-configuration">General configuration</a></h2>
<p>Variables prefixed with <code>YK_</code> allow the user to control aspects of yk's execution.</p>
<p>The following environment variables are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>YK_HOT_THRESHOLD</code>: an integer from 0..4294967295 (both inclusive) that
determines how many executions of a hot loop are needed before it is traced.
Defaults to 131.</li>
<li><code>YK_JITC</code>: selects the JIT compiler to use. Set to "none" to disable JIT
compilation entirely. When disabled, the hot location counter will not
increment, preventing any tracing or compilation from occurring. When not set,
defaults to JIT compilation enabled.</li>
<li><code>YK_SIDETRACE_THRESHOLD</code>: an integer from 0..4294967295 (both inclusive) that
determines how many times a guard needs to fail before a sidetrace is created.
Defaults to 5.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging"><a class="header" href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Variables prefixed with <code>YKD_</code> are intended to help interpreter authors debug
performance issues. Some are only available in certain compile-time
configurations of yk, either because they increase the binary size, or slow
performance down.</p>
<p>The following environment variables are available (some only in certain configurations of yk):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>YKD_LOG=[&lt;path&gt;:]&lt;level&gt;</code> specifies where, and how much, general information
yk will log during execution.</p>
<p>If <code>&lt;path&gt;:</code> (i.e. a path followed by ":") is specified then output is sent
to that path. The special value <code>-</code> (i.e. a single dash) can be used for
<code>&lt;path&gt;</code> to indicate stderr. If not specified, logs to stderr.</p>
<p><code>&lt;level&gt;</code> specifies the level of logging, each adding to the previous: level
0 turns off all yk logging; level 1 shows major errors only; and level 2
warnings. Levels above 3 are used for internal yk debugging, and their
precise output, and indeed the maximum level may change without warning.
Currently: level 3 shows tracing events (e.g. starting/stopping tracing);
and level 4 shows trace execution and deoptimisation. Note that some
information, at all levels, may or may not be displayed based on compile-time
options. Defaults to 1.</p>

implemented for the current platform).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="debugging-1"><a class="header" href="#debugging-1">Debugging</a></h1>
<h2 id="disabling-the-jit"><a class="header" href="#disabling-the-jit">Disabling the JIT</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to completely disable the JIT to verify that a problem is
JIT-related. You can do this with the <code>YK_JITC</code> environment variable (see
<a href="dev/runtime_config.html">run-time configuration</a> for details).</p>
<h2 id="trace-optimisation"><a class="header" href="#trace-optimisation">Trace optimisation</a></h2>
<p>Trace optimisation can make it difficult to understand why a yk interpreter has
behaved in the way it does. It is worth trying to run your code with the
optimiser turned off. You can do this with the <code>YKD_OPT</code> environment
variable, which takes the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: turn the optimiser on. Default if not otherwise specified.</li>
<li>0: turn the optimiser off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging-jitted-code"><a class="header" href="#debugging-jitted-code">Debugging JITted code</a></h2>
<p>Often you will find the need to inspect JITted code with a debugger. If the
problem trace comes from a C test (i.e. one of the test cases under <code>tests/c</code>),
then you can use the <code>gdb_c_test</code> tool.</p>
<p>The tool automates the compilation and invocation of the resulting binary
under GDB.</p>
<p>The simplest invocation of <code>gdb_c_test</code> (from the top-level of the <code>yk</code> repo)
would look like:</p>
<pre><code>bin/gdb_c_test simple.c
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically compile and run the <code>tests/c/simple.c</code> test under GDB.
This would be ideal if you have a crashing trace, as it will dump you into a
GDB shell at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>To see what else you can do with <code>gdb_c_test</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code>bin/gdb_c_test --help
</code></pre>
<p>For help on using GDB, see the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/">GDB
documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gdb-plugin"><a class="header" href="#gdb-plugin">GDB plugin</a></h3>
<p>Yk comes with a GDB plugin that allows the debugger to show higher-level
information in the source view window.</p>
<p>The plugin is built by default and put in <code>target/yk_gdb_plugin.so</code>.</p>
<p>To use it, put this line in <code>~/.gdbinit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>jit-reader-load /path/to/yk/target/yk_gdb_plugin.so
</code></pre>
<p>Then when you run GDB, you should see:</p>
<pre><code>Yk JIT support loaded.
</code></pre>
<p>When you are inside JITted code, the source view will show higher-level
debugging information. You can show the assembler and source views on one GDB
screen using the "split" layout. Type:</p>
<pre><code>la spl
</code></pre>

<h2 id="jit-statistics"><a class="header" href="#jit-statistics">JIT statistics</a></h2>
<p>At the end of an interpreter run, yk can print out some simple statistics about
what happened during execution. If the <code>YKD_LOG_STATS=&lt;path&gt;</code> environment
variable is defined, then JSON statistics will be written to the file at
<code>&lt;path&gt;</code> once the interpreter "drops" the <code>YkMt</code> instance. The
special value <code>-</code> (i.e. a single dash) can be used for <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> to indicate stderr.</p>
<p>Note that if the interpreter starts multiple yk instances, then the contents of
<code>&lt;file&gt;</code> are undefined (at best the file will be nondeterministically
overwritten as instances are "dropped", but output may be interleaved, or
otherwise bizarre).</p>
<p>Output from <code>YKD_LOG_STATS</code> looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{                                       
    "duration_compiling": 5.5219,                                               
    "duration_deopting": 2.2638,
    "duration_jit_executing": 0.2,
    "duration_outside_yk": 0.142,
    "duration_trace_mapping": 3.3797,                                           
    "traces_collected_err": 0,                                                  
    "traces_collected_ok": 11,                                                  
    "traces_compiled_err": 1,
    "traces_compiled_ok": 10                                                    
}
</code></pre>
<p>Fields and their meaning are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>duration_compiling</code>. Float, seconds. How long was spent compiling traces?</li>
<li><code>duration_deopting</code>. Float, seconds. How long was spent deoptimising from
failed guards?</li>
<li><code>duration_jit_executing</code>. Float, seconds. How long was spent executing JIT
compiled code?</li>
<li><code>duration_outside_yk</code>. Float, seconds. How long was spent outside yk? This
is a proxy for "how much time was spent in the interpreter", but is inherently
an over-approximation because we can't truly know exactly what the system
outside Yk counts as "interpreting" or not. For example, if an interpreter
thread puts itself to sleep, we will still count it as time spent
"outside yk".</li>
<li><code>duration_trace_mapping</code>. Float, seconds. How long was spent mapping a "raw"
trace to compiler-ready IR?</li>
<li><code>trace_executions</code>. Unsigned integer. How many times have traces been
executed? Note that the same trace can count arbitrarily many times to this.</li>
<li><code>traces_collected_err</code>. Unsigned integer. How many traces were collected
unsuccessfully?</li>
<li><code>traces_collected_ok</code>. Unsigned integer. How many traces were collected
successfully?</li>
<li><code>traces_compiled_err</code>. Unsigned integer. How many traces were compiled
unsuccessfully?</li>
<li><code>traces_compiled_ok</code>. Unsigned integer. How many traces were compiled
successfully?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="perf"><a class="header" href="#perf">Perf</a></h2>
<p>On Linux, <code>perf</code> can be used to profile yk. You first need to record an
execution of an interpreter and then separately view the profiling data that
was generated.</p>
<h3 id="recording-a-profile"><a class="header" href="#recording-a-profile">Recording a Profile</a></h3>
<p>To record a profile we first recommend compiling yk with debugging info
embedded. cargo's <code>debug</code> profile does this automatically, but because no code
optimisation is performed, the profiles are unrepresentative. We recommend
using yk's provided <code>profile-with-debug</code> profile, which turns on
<code>--release</code>-style code optimisation <em>and</em> embeds debugging information:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --profile=release-with-debug
</code></pre>
<p>Ensure that the interpreter you are profiling links to the appropriate version
of yk and then run:</p>
<pre><code>$ /path/to/yk/bin/yk_perf_record --call-graph dwarf -g ./interpreter ...args...
</code></pre>
<p>This uses <code>--call-graph dwarf</code> to force perf use DWARF debugging information:
this will only be useful if you have compiled yk with embedded debugging
information, as recommended above.</p>
<p>The <code>yk_perf_record</code> wrapper script sets <code>YKD_TPROF=1</code> and automates the task
of getting JITted code into the profile.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-a-profile"><a class="header" href="#viewing-a-profile">Viewing a profile</a></h3>
<p>perf profiles can be visualised in a number of ways. When using <code>perf report</code>
or <code>perf script</code> we currently recommend passing <code>--no-inline</code> to avoid the huge
processing time incurred by indirectly running <code>addr2line</code> (note that this
<a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/2021/09/09/perf-addr2line-speed-improvement">might change in the
future</a>).</p>
<h4 id="terminal"><a class="header" href="#terminal">Terminal</a></h4>
<p>To quickly view a profile in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ perf report -g --no-inline
</code></pre>
<h4 id="firefox-profiler"><a class="header" href="#firefox-profiler">Firefox profiler</a></h4>
<p>After processing perf's output, you can use <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/">Firefox's
Profiler</a> to view the data locally. Note that
this does not upload the data --- all processing happens in your browser! First
process the data:</p>
<pre><code>$ perf script -F +pid --no-inline &gt; out.perf
</code></pre>
<p>Then go to the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/">Firefox Profiler page</a>, press
"Load a profile from file" and upload <code>out.perf</code>.</p>
<h4 id="flame-graphs"><a class="header" href="#flame-graphs">Flame graphs</a></h4>
<p>You can make a flame graph using the Rust
<a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>flamegraph</code></a> tool. Install with
<code>cargo install flamegraph</code> and then use <code>flamegraph</code> to profile and produce a
flamegraph in one go with:</p>
<pre><code>$ /path/to/cargo/bin/flamegraph --no-inline -- ./interpreter ...args...
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>flamegraph</code> passes <code>--call-graph=dwarf</code> to <code>perf record</code> by default
(pass <code>-v</code> to see the exact perf invocation used).</p>
<p>This will produce an <code>svg</code> file which you can then view.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="understanding-traces"><a class="header" href="#understanding-traces">Understanding Traces</a></h1>
<p>yk can print the traces it has created to <code>stderr</code> to help with debugging.
However, these traces are often lengthy, and not always easy to understand.
This section briefly explains how to get yk to print its traces, and how
to make them a bit easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="producing-a-trace"><a class="header" href="#producing-a-trace">Producing a trace</a></h2>
<h3 id="ykd_log_ir"><a class="header" href="#ykd_log_ir"><code>YKD_LOG_IR</code></a></h3>
<p><code>YKD_LOG_IR=[&lt;path&gt;:]&lt;irstage_1&gt;[,...,&lt;irstage_n&gt;]</code> logs IR from different stages
to <code>path</code>. The special value <code>-</code> (i.e. a single dash) can be used for <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>
to indicate stderr.</p>
<p>The following <code>ir_stage</code>s are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aot</code>: the entire AOT IR for the interpreter.</li>
<li><code>jit-pre-opt</code>: the JIT IR trace before optimisation.</li>
<li><code>jit-post-opt</code>: the JIT IR trace after optimisation.</li>
<li><code>jit-asm</code>: the assembler code of the compiled JIT IR trace.</li>
<li><code>jit-asm-full</code>: the assembler code of the compiled JIT IR trace with
instruction offsets and virtual addresses annotated.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gotchas"><a class="header" href="#gotchas">Gotchas</a></h1>
<p>Yk has some unusual implications, requirements, and limitations that interpreter
authors should be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="trace-quality-depends-upon-completeness-of-interpreter-ir"><a class="header" href="#trace-quality-depends-upon-completeness-of-interpreter-ir">Trace quality depends upon completeness of interpreter IR.</a></h2>
<p>Yk works by recording traces (i.e. individual control flow paths) of your
interpreter's implementation. Each trace ends up as an ordered list of LLVM IR
blocks which are "stitched together" and compiled. Unless callees are marked
<code>yk_noinline</code>, the JIT will seek to inline them into the trace because,
generally speaking, the more the JIT can inline, the more optimal the JITted
code will be.</p>
<p>In order to inline a function call, the JIT needs to have LLVM IR for the
callee. Yk uses fat LTO to collect (and embed into the resulting binary) a
"full-program" IR for your interpreter. <code>yk-config</code> provides the relevant clang
flags to make this happen. You should make sure that the build system of your
interpreter uses the relevant flags. Namely <code>yk-config --cppflgs --cflags</code> for
compiling C code, and <code>yk-config --ldflags --libs</code> for linking.</p>
<p>It follows that shared objects, which at the time of writing cannot take part
in LTO, cannot be inlined into traces. If your interpreter <code>dlopen()</code>s shared
objects at runtime (as is common for C extensions) Yk will be unable to trace
the newly loaded code.</p>
<h2 id="symbol-visibility"><a class="header" href="#symbol-visibility">Symbol visibility</a></h2>
<p>The JIT relies upon the use of <code>dlsym()</code> at runtime in order to lookup any
given symbol from its virtual address. For this to work all symbols must be
exposed in the dynamic symbol table.</p>
<p><code>yk-config</code> provides flags to put every function's symbol into the dynamic
symbol table. Since distinct symbols of the same name can exist (e.g. <code>static</code>
functions in C), but dynamic symbol names must be unique, symbols may be
mangled (mangling is done by the fat LTO module merger). If your interpreter
does its own symbol introspection, Yk may break it.</p>
<h2 id="extra-sections-in-your-interpreter-binary"><a class="header" href="#extra-sections-in-your-interpreter-binary">Extra sections in your interpreter binary.</a></h2>
<p><code>yk-config</code> will add flags that add the following sections to your binary:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.llvmbc</code>: LLVM bytecode for your interpreter. Used to construct traces.
This is a standard LLVM section (but extended by Yk).</li>
<li><code>.llvm_bb_addr_map</code>: The basic block address map. Used to map virtual
addresses back to LLVM IR blocks. This is a standard LLVM section (but
extended by Yk).</li>
<li><code>.llvm_stackmaps</code>: Stackmap table. Used to identify the locations of live
LLVM IR variables. This is a standard LLVM section (but extended by Yk).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-interpreter-requirements-and-gotchas"><a class="header" href="#other-interpreter-requirements-and-gotchas">Other interpreter requirements and gotchas</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yk can only currently work with "simple interpreter loop"-style interpreters
and cannot yet handle unstructured interpreter loops (e.g. threaded
dispatch).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yk currently assumes that no new code is loaded at runtime (e.g.
<code>dlopen()</code>), and that no code is unloaded (e.g. <code>dlclose()</code>). Self modifying
interpreters will also confuse the JIT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yk currently doesn't handle calls to <code>pthread_exit()</code> gracefully (<a href="https://github.com/ykjit/yk/issues/525">more
details</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yk currently doesn't handle <code>setjmp()</code>/<code>longjmp()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot valgrind an interpreter that is using Intel PT for tracing (<a href="https://github.com/ykjit/yk/issues/177">more

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pull-requests"><a class="header" href="#pull-requests">Pull Requests</a></h1>
<p>We welcome all and any contributions, from code to documentation to examples,
submitted as <em>pull requests</em> to one of our <a href="https://github.com/ykjit/">GitHub
repositories</a>. Pull requests are reviewed by a yk
contributor: changes may be requested in an ongoing dialogue between reviewee
and reviewer; and, if and when agreement is reached, the pull request will be
merged.</p>
<p>This page explains yk's approach to the pull request model, based on
observations of good practise in other projects, and our own experiences.
Please note that this is a living process: the details are subject to continual
refinement and change, and no document can perfectly capture all the
possibilities that will crop up in real life.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-pull-request"><a class="header" href="#what-makes-a-good-pull-request">What makes a good pull request?</a></h2>
<p>The typical aim of a pull request to a yk repository is to make a focussed
change such as: add a new feature; fix a bug; or edit documentation. Good pull
requests are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Self-contained</em>. A pull request should not try and change everything at
once. Ideally a pull request fixes a single bug or adds a single feature;
but sometimes a set of interdependent fixes or features makes more sense.
In general, small pull requests are better than big pull requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tested</em>. Every piece of new functionality, and every bug fix, must have
at least one accompanying test, unless testing is impractical. Authors
should also strive not to break any other part of the system. yk runs
various tests before a pull request is merged: this reduces, but does
not remove, the chances of a merged pull request breaking expectations:
careful thought and testing on the part of the pull request author are
still required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Documented</em>. Code diffs show <em>what</em> has been changed, but not <em>why</em>.
Documentation explains to other humans the context for a change (i.e. why
something needed to be changed), the reason why the change is as it is
(i.e. could the change have taken a different form? what alternatives were
considered or attempted?), and the consequences of doing so (i.e. does
this make something easier or harder in the future?). Documentation comes
in the form of comments in code, "external" documentation (such as you
read here), and commit and pull request messages. In whatever form it
comes, documentation must be clear (as easy to understand as possible),
concise (as short as possible while getting all the required points
across), complete (not missing any important points), and necessary (not
documenting that which is obvious).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Useful</em>. The more people that will benefit from a pull request, the more
likely it is to be merged. The bar for "useful" is set fairly low, but
that does not mean that every pull request should be merged: for example,
a pull request which simply changes code to your preferred style is not
only not useful but may cause problems for other people working in
parallel. However, porting the code to a little used platform is often
useful (provided it doesn't cause undue problems for more widely used
platforms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Harmonious</em>. As far as possible, new code should feel like a natural
extension of existing code. Following existing naming conventions, for
example, can sometimes grate, but internal consistency helps those who
read and edit the code later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-reviewer-and-reviewee-covenant"><a class="header" href="#the-reviewer-and-reviewee-covenant">The reviewer and reviewee covenant</a></h2>
<p>The aim of pull request reviewing is to make yk better while ensuring that our
quality standards are maintained. Ultimately, it is in yk's best interests for
all pull requests which satisfy the criteria listed in the previous section to
be merged in.</p>
<p>Both reviewer and reviewee have their part to play in making this process work.
Most importantly, both parties must assume good faith on the part of the other:
for example, questions are an opportunity to learn or explain, not to attack.
Clear, polite, communication between both parties is required at all times.
Reviewers should respond in a timely manner to comments, while understanding
that reviewees may have many outside responsibilities that mean their responses
are less timely.</p>
<p>Reviewers should help a reviewee meet the expected standards, via questioning
and explicit guidance, without setting the bar unnecessarily high. Reviewers
need to accept:</p>
<ul>
<li>that a pull request cannot solve every problem, and some problems are best
deferred to a future pull request;</li>
<li>and that some variance of individual style is inevitable and acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put another way, while we set high standards, and require all contributions to
meet them, we are not foolish enough to expect perfection. In particular,
reviewers must be welcoming to newcomers, who may not be familiar with our
processes or standards, and adjust accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="the-pull-request-process-in-yk-repositories"><a class="header" href="#the-pull-request-process-in-yk-repositories">The pull request process in yk repositories</a></h2>
<p>To raise a pull request, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fork the relevant yk GitHub repository to your account. Note that pull
requests must never come from a branch on a yk repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new branch in your fork. If you are unsure about the name, start
with something generic and rename it later with <code>git branch -m &lt;new name&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your changes and commit them. It is not only allowed, but often best,
to have multiple commits: each commit should be a logical change building
upon one of its predecessors. Each commit should be capable of passing all
tests successfully (amongst other things, to avoid breaking <code>git bisect</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push your branch to your GitHub fork and raise a pull request. Give the
pull request a meaningful title (for example, "Fix bug" is not helpful but
"Deal with an empty list correctly" is) and a description (empty
descriptions are almost never acceptable). If the pull request fixes all
aspects of a GitHub issue, add the text <code>Fixes #&lt;GitHub issue number&gt;</code>, as
a line on its own, into the description: GitHub will then automatically
close that issue when the pull request is merged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your pull request has now been raised and will be reviewed by a yk contributor.
The aim of a review is two fold: to ensure that contributions to yk are of an
acceptable quality; and that at least two people (the reviewer and reviewee)
understand what was changed and why.</p>
<p>The reviewer will comment in detail on specific lines of the commit and on the
overall pull request. Comments might be queries (e.g. "can the list ever be
empty at this point?") or corrections (e.g. "we need to deal with the
possibility of an empty list at this point"). For each comment you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Address the issue. For example, if the reviewer has pointed out correctly
that something needs to be changed then:</p>
<ol>
<li>make a small additional commit (one per fix);</li>
<li>push it to your branch;</li>
<li>and, in the same place as the reviewer made their comment, add a new
comment <code>Fixed in &lt;git hash&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reviewer will then review your change and either: mark the
conversation as "resolved" if their point is adequately addressed; or
raise further comments otherwise.</p>
<p>Note that the reviewee must not: mark conversations as resolved (only the
reviewer should do so); force push updates to your branch unless
explicitly requested to do so by the reviewer (always make new commits on
the existing branch).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a query. You might not understand the reviewer's question: it's fine
to ask for clarification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why you think there is not an issue. The reviewer might have
misunderstood either the details of a change, or the pull request's
context (e.g. the pull request might not have intended to fix every
possible issue). A complete, and polite explanation, can help both
reviewer and reviewee focus on the essentials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Often multiple rounds of comments, queries, and fixes are required. When the
reviewer is happy with the changes, they will ask the reviewee to "please
squash" their pull request. The aim here is to provide a readable sequence of
commits for those who later need to look at the history of changes to a
particular part of the repository. The general aim is to provide a pleasing
sequence of individually documented commits which clearly articulate a change to future
readers. At the very least, all of the "fix commits" must be merged away:
commonly, these are merged into the main commits, or, though rarely, into a new
commit(s). It is not required, and is often undesirable, to squash all commits
down into a single commit: when multiple commits can better explain a change,
they are much preferred. During squashing, you should also check that commit
messages still accurately document their contents: revise those which need
updating.</p>
<p>The process of squashing is synonymous with <code>git rebase</code>, so when you are asked
to squash it is also acceptable to: rebase the commit against the <code>master</code>
branch at the same time; and force push the resulting rebased branch.</p>
<p>Not that being asked to squash or to update a commit message are the only times
you may force push an update to a branch. In both cases, the reviewee must only
do so when explicitly asked to by a reviewer. If you are unsure, please ask a
reviewer before force pushing.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>Most of us prefer programming to writing documentation, whether that
documentation is in the form of a comment or commit description (etc). That can
lead us to rush, or omit, documentation, making life difficult for pull request
reviewers and future contributors. We must prioritise creating and maintaining
documentation.</p>
<p>yk's documentation must be clear, concise, and complete. A good rule of thumb
is to write documentation to the quality you would like to read it: use
"proper" English (e.g. avoid colloquialisms), capitalise and punctuate
appropriately, and don't expect to phrase things perfectly on your first
attempt.</p>
<p>In the context of pull requests, bear in mind that the code captures <em>what</em> has
been changed, but not <em>why</em>: good documentation explains the context of a
change, the reason the change is as it is, and the consequences of the change.
The pull request itself should come with a description of what it aims to
achieve and each individual commit must also contain a self-contained
description of its changes.</p>
<h2 id="formatting"><a class="header" href="#formatting">Formatting</a></h2>
<p>yk's continuous integration setup only accepts contributions of well-formatted
code. Changed Rust code must be formatted with <code>cargo fmt</code>. Changed C++ code
must be formatted with <code>cargo xtask cfmt</code>. Please run both before you raise PR,
and rerun them each time you are about to make a commit in response to reviewer
comments.</p>
<h2 id="automated-testing"><a class="header" href="#automated-testing">Automated testing</a></h2>
<p>Before pull requests are merged into yk they must pass automated tests. yk uses
<a href="https://bors.tech/">bors</a> and <a href="https://www.buildbot.net/">Buildbot</a> to run the
<code>.buildbot.sh</code> file in yk's root in a fresh Docker image: if that file executes
successfully, the pull request is suitable for merging. Pull requests may edit
<code>.buildbot.sh</code> as with any other file, though one must be careful not to slow
down how long it takes to run unduly. In general, only yk contributors can
issue <code>bors</code> commands, though they can in certain situations give external
users the right to issue commands on a given pull request. Users given this
privilege should use it responsibly.</p>
