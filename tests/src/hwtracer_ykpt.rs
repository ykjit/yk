//! Testing and benchmarking bits for perftracer's ykpt decoder.
//!
//! Why is this so convoluted? Read on...
//!
//! Ideally tests and benchmarks would be written in pure Rust, however the ykpt
//! decoder relies on the block map section inserted by ykllvm. This means that the tests and
//! benchmarks have to be LTO linked by ykllvm, and be written in C. But the plot thickens, as the
//! kinds of things we want the tests to check are Rust-based, so we will have to call back into
//! Rust somehow.
//!
//! To that end, the test files in `tests/perftracer_ykpt` are compiled into test binaries (as a
//! langtester suite) and then they call into this file to have assertions checked in Rust code.
